### Assistantship
During my time in grad school, I held a position with the MIS department at the Terry School of Business and built out several web applications (some of which have been made public and are available below).

These web applications were developed for greenhouse growers as part of [Project LAMP](https://www.hortlamp.org/outreach/determine-lighting/), lighting approaches to maximize profits. Our goal is to maximize controlled environment agriculture (CEA) grower profits through improved lighting systems and support tools.

These calculators (LightingCalc, SupplementalCalc, and TargetCalc) use a geolocation API to transform a user inputted zipcode to latitude and longitude which is then passed to the TMY API to retrieve location specific weather data. From there, the three calculators being to differentiate themselves:

#### LightingCalc
**Background:** When I started my assistantship, two previous students who held this position had developed LightingCalc. My first task was to tweak the UI and logic to display values at a weekly view as opposed to a monthly view. After familiarizing myself with LightingCalc, I discovered that it was making an unrealistic assumption: growers want to provide enough supplemental light to reach their target DLI _every single day of the year_. Because of that unrealistic assumption, this calculator does not calculate demand charges, only the cost of the electricity used.

**Description:** LightingCalc was created to determine how much electricity is required to reach the target DLI every single day of the year. To do so, a lighting system would need to be designed to provide enough light on even the darkest day of the year. On the Electricity Cost page, users will view a dashboard....
